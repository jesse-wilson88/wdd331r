    <h1>Site: <a target="_blank" href="https://costco.ca/">https://costco.ca/</a></h1>
    <p>Testing tool: Google Lighthouse (via Inspect)</p>
    <p>
      One of the problems I had was trying to use the tool that was not viewed
      from within the inspect window of chrome. I tried to use web.dev but it
      seems they have removed it from their page and are recommending people go
      to <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev">https://pagespeed.web.dev</a>. Took me a little bit to find that in the
      original site. I am not sure how you wanted this presented but I thought
      this would work well.
    </p>
    <p>
      I am not a seasoned programmer for websites at this time, so I can only
      search for things that make sense to me at this time and do my best to
      interpret what I am reading.

    <h1>Performance:</h1>
    <p>
      <b>Reduce unused JavaScript ‚Äì</b> They could use Code splitting with React.lazy
      and suspense. When I read about this, the first thing that came to mind
      was lazy loading which allowed us to look at a page and not load all
      images until it was close to be viewed scrolled or navigated to. This
      prevented all images from being loaded all at once. This seems to do the
      same thing in some ways. It is used to load different parts of the
      application only when it is needed. Looking at some of the unused function
      in JS, I can see why it would not be used at the time. It is because when
      you have sections with IF statements and it does not meet those
      requirements, they will never be used or at least at times. I also noticed
      that if you run lighthouse again, the results could be a little different.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Defer offscreen images ‚Äì</b> I rewrote the one above to hopefully make it
      sound better. It was not till I got to this part that I remember what it
      was called. Lazy loading allows images to be downloaded (be viewed by the
      user) when they scroll or navigate through the website. In lighthouse
      report, it mentioned using lazy-loader for off screen and hidden images
      after all the critical resources were finished loading.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Reduce unused CSS ‚Äì</b> I have never maintained a large website before. So
      what I am about to say could be wrong but my first thought would be to
      remove all unused CSS code. Why not? If it is not being used, then don‚Äôt
      have it in the code. Now maybe a good thing would be to have a file with
      unused code so if you find that you really needed it, you do not have to
      recreate it, but could take it out of the unused file and put it back with
      the used code. But comment well on the unused file so you know where it
      was located and anything else one would want to add to it. Now looking at
      other resources, they say the unused CSS should be removed. One can view
      the unused CSS from inspecting the page and looking at the Coverage tab.
      There are some sites one could use to do this. I tried PurifyCSS but it
      had issues when I tried it. As I am writing this I found this site and
      trying UnusedCSS. The following site has a few more one could use.
      UnusedCSS failed for some reason. Maybe there is too much to load and be
      tested‚Ä¶lol
    </p>

      <b>Preload Largest Contentful Paint image ‚Äì</b> This seems weird. The defer
      offscreen images, if I am correct, is to load last and even until a user
      scrolls or navigates to that portion of the site. But LCP is for loading
      first hence the word preload. If seems to mean preloading the image before
      the user even requests it. I guess this can be done by using the ‚Äúpreload‚Äù
      attribute, using JavaScript to dynamically load the image or by using a
      web performance optimization tool or framework to automatically preload
      important page assets.

      I have worked in a lot of network closets working in the military and even
      in my current job as a Computer Technician. One of my biggest things about
      doing the cabling in a network closet is, if you do it right the first
      time, you should never have to touch it again. I had that same thought
      going over this week‚Äôs content. But shortly after, that thought went
      away‚Ä¶lol The main reason is because the thought came into my mind that
      programming changes so fast and often, that there is no way you could make
      the perfect website and not have to update content in it to keep it
      running. üòä
